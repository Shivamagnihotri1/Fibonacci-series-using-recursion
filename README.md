 Data Structures and algorithm
Recursion means “solving the problem via the solution of the smaller version of the same problem” or “defining a problem in terms of itself”.
Any recursive function will look like

function(arg1,arg2,....)
{
    if( Base Case Condition )
    {
        // Base Case
    }
    // Recursive Structure
    
}
